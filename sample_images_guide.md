# GoatMorpho - Sample Image Guidelines

## Best Types of Images for Accurate Measurements

### ‚úÖ Ideal Image Characteristics

1. **Side Profile View** - The goat should be photographed from the side (90-degree angle)
2. **Standing Position** - The goat should be standing upright with all four legs visible
3. **Good Lighting** - Natural daylight or well-lit conditions
4. **Clear Background** - Minimal background clutter
5. **Full Body Visible** - The entire goat should be in frame
6. **High Resolution** - At least 800x600 pixels
7. **Sharp Focus** - No motion blur

### üìê Reference Object (Optional)

Including a reference object of known length (like a ruler, coin, or measuring tape) can improve measurement accuracy:

- Place the reference object near the goat
- Ensure it's clearly visible and in the same plane as the goat
- Note the actual length when uploading

### üì∏ Photography Tips

#### Camera Position

- Position yourself at the same height as the goat's middle body
- Keep the camera parallel to the ground
- Maintain a distance of 3-6 feet from the goat

#### Lighting

- Use natural outdoor lighting when possible
- Avoid harsh shadows or backlighting
- Ensure the goat's features are clearly visible
- Indoor photos should have adequate lighting from multiple directions

#### Goat Positioning

- The goat should be standing naturally
- All four legs should be visible and properly positioned
- Head should be in a natural position (not turned away)
- Avoid photos where the goat is lying down, jumping, or moving

### ‚ùå Images to Avoid

1. **Front or Back View** - Makes measurements impossible
2. **Angled Views** - Perspective distortion affects measurements
3. **Poor Lighting** - Dark, shadowy, or backlit images
4. **Motion Blur** - Blurry images from movement
5. **Partial Views** - Only parts of the goat visible
6. **Cluttered Background** - Too many distracting elements
7. **Low Resolution** - Pixelated or very small images

### üéØ Sample Scenarios

#### Perfect Example

```
Goat standing in profile on grass field,
natural daylight, all body parts visible,
clear background, sharp focus
```

#### Good Example

```
Indoor photo with good lighting,
goat in profile against plain wall,
measuring tape visible for reference
```

#### Poor Example

```
Goat at an angle, shadows covering parts,
only front half visible, low resolution
```

### üîß Technical Requirements

- **File Formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB
- **Resolution**: Minimum 640x480, Recommended 1200x800+
- **Color**: Color images preferred over black and white

### üìä Measurement Accuracy

The system extracts these 17 morphometric measurements:

1. Hauteur au garrot (Height at withers)
2. Longueur du corps (Body length)
3. Tour de poitrine (Chest circumference)
4. Hauteur √† la croupe (Height at croup)
5. Largeur de poitrine (Chest width)
6. Largeur aux hanches (Hip width)
7. Longueur de la t√™te (Head length)
8. Largeur de la t√™te (Head width)
9. Tour de t√™te (Head circumference)
10. Longueur des oreilles (Ear length)
11. Longueur du cou (Neck length)
12. Tour du cou (Neck circumference)
13. Longueur de la croupe (Croup length)
14. Largeur de la croupe (Croup width)
15. Longueur du canon ant√©rieur (Front cannon length)
16. Longueur du canon post√©rieur (Rear cannon length)
17. Tour du canon (Cannon circumference)

### üöÄ Quick Start

1. Take a side-profile photo of your goat
2. Ensure good lighting and sharp focus
3. Upload through the web interface
4. Add reference length if available
5. Review the measurements and processed image

For best results, practice taking photos with these guidelines before important measurements!
